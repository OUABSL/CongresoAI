\section{Conclusions and future work}
\label{cafw}

The paper's main contribution lies in a novel framework for graph queries that permits the polynomial cyclic assessment of queries and refinements based on atomic operations. The framework's ability to apply refinements in relational learning processes was also demonstrated. In addition, the presented framework fulfils several essential requirements. The system utilises a consistent grammar for both queries and evaluated structures. It allows the assessment of subgraphs beyond individual nodes and supports cyclic queries within polynomial time (where the length of the query path is limited). The system offers a controlled and automated query construction via refinements, and the refinement sets constitute embedded partitions of the evaluated structure set, making them effective tools for top-down learning techniques.

Graph isomorphism-based query systems exhibit exponential complexity when presented with cyclic queries. Additionally, if a projection is necessary for pattern verification, evaluating the non-existence of specific elements becomes difficult or even impossible. However, the query graph framework offered here assesses the existence/non-existence of paths and nodes in a graph rather than demanding isomorphisms, thus enabling the evaluation of cyclic patterns in polynomial time. 

After conducting an initial and fully functional proof-of-concept implementation, the graph query framework's capabilities have been demonstrated through experimentation. This methodology has been explicitly applied in relational learning procedures, as demonstrated in section \ref{kd}, and the results of these experiments have shown that interesting patterns can be extracted from relational data. This is of great significance in both explainable learning and automatic feature extraction tasks. The results' graphs were obtained via our proof-of-concept implementation on a graph database and employing the \textit{matplotlib} library \citep{hunter}.

Despite the presented query definition utilizing binary graph data sets (rather than hypergraphs), it can be implemented on hypergraph data as well. This is due to the fact that the concept of a path, which connects pairs of nodes, is independent of the edge arity involved. For the sake of simplicity, and due to the absence of true hypergraph databases, our queries have been limited to the binary case. Nevertheless, they can be adapted to more universal cases once the usage of hypergraphs becomes more widespread.

Also, in Section \ref{refs}, a basic and reliable set of refinement operations have been provided. However, they should not be considered the most suitable solution for all types of learning tasks. To achieve complex queries and to prevent plateaus in the pattern space, more complex refinement families can be established. For example, it is possible to combine the operations \emph{ add edge} and \emph{adding property to an edge} into one step, thereby reducing the number of steps required. If executed properly, unifying the refinements based on the frequency of structural occurrences in a graph, for instance, can lead to faster versions of learning algorithms at the expense of covering a broader query space. This work provides theoretical tools to support the accuracy of new refinement families. Future research will focus on developing automated methods to generate refinement sets based on a given learning task and the specific characteristics of the graph dataset. Extracting statistics from the graph data for automatic generation of such sets can result in significant optimizations. 

It is concluded that it is feasible to establish effective techniques for matching graph patterns and learning symbolic relationships, resulting in systematic exploration of the pattern space, a high degree of expressiveness in queries and computational cost of implementations kept in reasonable orders.
%Complexity associated to queries within the proposed framework is polynomial. However, the constant $k$ that limits the length of the paths searched in the graph plays a fundamental role (section \ref{cc}). For this reason, care must be taken to define such a bounding so that the query system remains viable. Being $d$ the number of attributes and $m$ the number of examples, complexity of decision tree learning algorithms belongs to $\mathcal{O}(d \times m \times \log m)$  \citep{witten2016data}. Thus, complexity of our proposed relational decision tree learning algorithm is polynomial too. As efficiency is one of the major problems for this kind of learning techniques, the higher efficiency of the complete relational learning framework presented here may be very promising.

Patterns associated with the leaves in obtained decision trees can be used to characterize subgraph categories. Moreover, the path from the root node to the corresponding leaf of the decision tree for a particular input can be used to justify decisions, a beneficial feature in various sensitive applications as in decision trees. In addition, patterns obtained from the graph learning procedure presented can serve as features in other machine learning methods. Once the patterns have been acquired, they can serve as Boolean features for subgraph modeling, enabling non-relational machine learning methods to learn from them.

Learning of relational decision trees can be utilised by \textit{ensemble} methods (such as Random Forest), and although the explanatory power is diluted when multiple trees are combined, its predictive power can be greatly enhanced. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the probabilistic amalgamation of queries to generate patterns that can be interpreted as probabilistic decision tools. 

Furthermore, while a relational decision tree learning technique has been employed, additional machine learning algorithms can be evaluated alongside this query framework to investigate more opportunities for relational learning.
